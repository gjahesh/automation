This project is created for [Homework9](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/hw09_automation.html#big-picture) of [STAT547](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/) course. 

The aim is Shows how to create a small-but-automated analytical pipeline using a Makefile AND using rmarkdown::render() on plain R scripts and R Markdown files, without the help of RStudio's buttons.

Demonstration Data : The raw data from the [Candy Survey](http://boingboing.net/2015/10/31/the-candy-hierarchy-2015-your.html) is the survey [David Ng](https://twitter.com/ng_dave) and [Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/somelaterdate) put together.
You can read their article here in [2015 Candy Hierarchy](http://boingboing.net/2015/10/31/the-candy-hierarchy-2015-your.html) and look
